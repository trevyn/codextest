# codextest

This repository includes a simple command-line RPG written in Rust.

## Running the game

Use Cargo to build and run the project from the repository root:
```bash
cargo run -- [--automatic]
```

The optional `--automatic` flag plays the game automatically and prints a log
of each action until the battle concludes.
